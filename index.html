<p>We are Horace Mann’s FTC Robotics Team, comprised of 14 members. Last year, we were an all freshman team, and even though we were not technically considered a “rookie” team due to our being founded seven years ago, we were all rookies then. Now, we are FTC veterans, and we are working hard to advance even farther than we ever have before.
Last year we competed at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, the Syosset Qualifier, the Hudson Valley State Qualifier, and made it to the Hudson Valley State Championship. At our first competition we were nominated for the Motivate and Inspire Awards. At Syosset, we were nominated for the PTC Design Award, the Connect Award, and received the 3rd Place Inspire Award. At the Hudson Valley Qualifier, we won the Rockwell Collins Innovate Award. 
Our mentor is Ms. Danah Screen, a computer science teacher at our school. She devotes much of her time and energy to our team, guiding us through our season and helping us learn and grow as a team.  </p>

<a id="mission-statement" class="anchor" href="#mission-statement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission Statement</h1>

<p>Our goal is to work as a cohesive unit to build and program our robot to the best of our abilities. We try to use every opportunity we have to help or meet other teams. We also hold ourselves to the values as outlined in our school’s Core Community Values, which include:
The Life of the Mind,
    Mature Behavior,
    Mutual Respect,
    A Secure and Healthful Environment,and
    A Balance Between Individual Achievement and a Caring Community</p>

<a id="committees" class="anchor" href="#committees" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Committees</h1>

<p>Our team is organized into three committees: Hardware, Software and Public Relations. Our Hardware Committee designs and builds the physical aspects of our robot, from the chassis to the devices that enable us to complete challenges in competition. Our Software Committee programs and wires our robot, developing complex autonomous codes and arranging the electronics on the robot. Our Public Relations Committee manages the team’s schedule and supplies, organizes outreach events to establish connections with other teams or engineering groups, and promotes the team through social media and designs/videos. </p>

<p>Simba 2015-2016:
    During the Hudson Valley Qualifier, we found that our robot wasn’t able to perform the tasks we had hoped, and wasn’t up to the caliber we expected, so we started to design a new robot that we could compete with at states. One major reason for changing our robot because our old robot was over the motor limit, due to our 6 wheel drive system, so we decided to try using treads on our new robot because we would only need two motors. On our old robot, our linear slides couldn’t reach far enough for the churros, and had a fairly limited range of motion. For the arm on our new robot, we needed longer channels, so we used three channels and two linear slides stacked on top of one another; this would also make it stronger, unlike our old linear slides that kept on breaking because we had two individual slides.We also wanted a more triangular shape this time, instead of the rectangular shape our previous robot had. This made it easier for the robot to climb the mountain. We got inspiration from the other robots at the qualifier, and created a preliminary design.
For this robot we wanted to try to do as many of the challenges possible, with our main focus being climbing the mountain, as that is the field component that gives the most points. We also wanted to create a spinbrush mechanism that would attach to the back the robot and collect debris, but due to the shortage of time, we decided to focus on the arm, and take that mechanism off. We kept the parts of the robot that were consistently successful at our last competitions, such as wings to get the zipliners. In addition, we added a flat with a plastic hook for climbers, and a flat for the all clear signal as well.</p>

<pre><code>2015-2016:
</code></pre>

<p>Every Friday, teaching and mentoring the kindergarteners on robotics and programming
Hosting two competitions (FLL and FTC) at our school, staying the night before to set up/build, and volunteering for the whole day to help with crowd control, judging, announcing, assisting other teams, inspections, etc. 
Mentoring the Girls Robotics team in the middle division, a club that one of our FTC members founded
Lending materials and equipment to other teams during competition
Our place in the larger engineering community:
We are one robotics team out of two in the upper division (FTC and FRC)
A lot of us came from the Girls Robotics Team in the Middle Division. Another team in the MD is the FLL Basement Cubs.
We are the FTC Basement Lions and we try to help other teams in our school as much as possible and they do the same for us. It is genuinely one big caring community where we share knowledge and passion for robotics. 
We try to reach out to our coaches, teachers, and other engineers who we know we can learn from.
One of our team members’ (Maya Dubno’s) father owns a machine shop and is very experienced/ knowledgeable about building, robotics, and programming. We went to the shop twice to work/build. 
We reached out to Mr. Z, who is a high school physics teacher here at HM. He helped us solve many problems with the movement of our robot.
Mr. Levy coaches FRC, and Mr. Torres is one of our robotics teachers and coaches FLL. They’ve helped us significantly with robot malfunctions, buying tools, and gave tips for competitions.
Our wonderful coach, Ms. Screen guided us throughout this journey, and devoted much of her time and energy to this team. She has taught us much of what we know , and none of this would be possible without her.</p>
